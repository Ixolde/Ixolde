My name is Ixolde or Ixol, I'm a software engineer and cybersecurity student.  
I'm currently in college full-time while working part-time.  
Give me at least a few days to respond to messages.

I'm developing an original horror sci-fi RPG called **Projection**.  
I will reveal more information about the game when the demo is released.

**Active Projects:**
- Projection
- My website

**Other Projects:**  
I have various mods planned for *Harvest Moon: Back to Nature* (PSP).  
Art commissions are currently closed.
